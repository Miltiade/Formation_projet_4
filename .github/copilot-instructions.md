# Copilot Instructions

1. Our team is learning software development and Python programming. Always explain thoroughly and ensure that you are understood. 
2. When suggesting code: always include comments (with #) for clarity; always include short, relevant debugging prints; always include debugging code snippets assessing nature and relevance of input and output of functions.
3. Always use the entire current workspace as context before answering.
4. Always write concisely, precisely, and to the point.
5. Ask for context.
6. When providing assistance (i.e. answering or suggesting fixes), always be as concise as possible, and always suggest the simplest and most stable solutions. (As in Ockham's razor principle).
