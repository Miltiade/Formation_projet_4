# Copilot Instructions

1. Our team is learning software development, and specifically Python programming. Always explain thoroughly and make sure that you are understood.
--. When providing assistance (i.e. answering or suggesting fixes), always be as concise as possible, and always suggest the simplest and most stable solutions. (As in Ockham's razor principle). 
2. When suggesting code: always include comments (with #) for clarity; always include debugging prints.
3. Whenever prompted by user, always use the entire current workspace as context before answering.
4. Always write concisely, precisely, and to the point.
